## Performance Characteristics

### Standard Queue
- **Throughput**: Nearly unlimited
- **Ordering**: Best-effort
- **Delivery**: At-least-once
- **Use Case**: High-volume applications where order doesn't matter

### FIFO Queue
- **Throughput**: 300 messages/sec (3,000 with batching)
- **Ordering**: Guaranteed FIFO
- **Delivery**: Exactly-once
- **Use Case**: Financial transactions, order processing

### Benchmark Results (from tests)
- **Batch Send**: 100,000+ messages per minute
- **Concurrent Processing**: 20+ workers processing simultaneously
- **Long Polling**: 5-20 second wait times for cost optimization

## Integration Points

The implementation follows the same patterns as existing AWS services:
- Similar to DynamoDB implementation structure
- Consistent configuration patterns
- Same dependency injection approach
- Compatible logging and error handling

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   # Start LocalStack for local testing
   docker run -d -p 4566:4566 localstack/localstack
   ```

2. **Configure**:
   - Update `appsettings.json` with AWS credentials
   - Or use IAM roles for production

3. **Register Services**:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddAmazonSqs(builder.Configuration);
   ```

4. **Use in Code**:
   ```csharp
   public class OrderService
   {
       private readonly ISqsClient _sqsClient;
       
       public OrderService(ISqsClient sqsClient)
       {
           _sqsClient = sqsClient;
       }
       
       public async Task ProcessOrderAsync(Order order)
       {
           await _sqsClient.SendMessageAsync("orders-queue", order);
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   dotnet test Custom.Framework.Tests\Custom.Framework.Tests.csproj --filter FullyQualifiedName~AmazonSqsTests
   ```

## Production Considerations

- Configure appropriate visibility timeouts based on processing time
- Use dead letter queues for failed messages
- Enable CloudWatch metrics for monitoring
- Use long polling to reduce costs
- Implement idempotency for message processing
- Consider FIFO queues only when ordering is critical
- Use batch operations for high throughput

## Cost Optimization

- Long polling reduces API calls by ~90%
- Batch operations reduce API calls by ~90%
- Set appropriate message retention periods
- Use Standard queues when FIFO isn't required
- Monitor dead letter queues to prevent infinite retries
